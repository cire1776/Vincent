# Vincent

**Vincent** is a next-generation Git patch and staging tool inspired by the creativity and precision of Vincent van Gogh. It lets you visually organize, sculpt, and commit your changes with the artistry of a master—making complex workflows simple, intuitive, and even fun.

## Features

- Visual drag-and-drop patch management
- Organize changes into “Palettes” (unsorted) and “Easels” (staging areas)
- Fine-grained patch sculpting (down to sub-line level)
- Multi-index support for advanced workflows
- Integrated test runner and terminal
- Designed for CI/CO and blob-heavy projects
- Clean, modern, and approachable UI

## Why Vincent?

Traditional Git tools are powerful, but can be overwhelming for creative, iterative, or large-scale workflows. Vincent brings a new approach—combining the flexibility of patch-based staging with a visual, artist-inspired interface.
